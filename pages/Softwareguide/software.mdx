### Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is a generative model that can be used to create realistic and diverse images. It was developed by the start-up Stability AI in collaboration with a number of academic researchers and non-profit organizations. Stable Diffusion is a latent diffusion model, a kind of deep generative neural network.

Stable Diffusion works by first creating a latent space, which is a high-dimensional space that represents all possible images. The model then learns to map from the latent space to the real image space. This mapping is done by a neural network that is trained on a dataset of images.

To generate an image, Stable Diffusion starts with a random image in the latent space. The model then iteratively updates the image by adding noise and then removing the noise. The noise is added in a way that encourages the image to become more realistic. The process is repeated until the image is satisfactory.

Stable Diffusion has been shown to be able to generate realistic and diverse images. It has been used to create images of people, animals, objects, and scenes. The model has also been used to create images of fictional characters and objects.

Stable Diffusion is a powerful tool that can be used to create a wide variety of images. It is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for artists, designers, and researchers.

Here are some examples of the open source models. 

### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

GPT is a series of large language models developed by OpenAI. These models are based on the transformer architecture and have made significant advancements in natural language processing and generation. 

    * GPT-1: Introduced in 2018, GPT-1 was the initial version of the series. It demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-training models on a vast amount of text data and fine-tuning them for specific tasks.

    * GPT-2: Released in 2019, GPT-2 garnered significant attention due to its impressive language generation capabilities. It consisted of 1.5 billion parameters, enabling it to produce coherent and contextually relevant text across various domains. However, GPT-2's release was accompanied by concerns about potential misuse, leading to limited access to the full model initially.

    * GPT-3: Unveiled in 2020, GPT-3 is the largest and most influential model in the series to date. It had a staggering 175 billion parameters, allowing it to generate remarkably human-like text. GPT-3 demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including text completion, translation, question-answering, and more.

    * GPT-3.5: OpenAI has quietly rolled out a series of AI models based on GPT-3.5 in 2022, an improved version of GPT-3. The first of these models, ChatGPT, was unveiled at the end of November. ChatGPT is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that can engage in conversations about a variety of topics, such as prose writing, programming, script and dialogues, and explaining scientific concepts to varying degrees of complexity. 

    * GPT-4: The GPT-4 model is released in 2023. GPT-4 is the largest and most powerful GPT model yet, and it is capable of generating text that is even more human-like than GPT-3. It is a large **multimodal model** (accepting image and text inputs, emitting text outputs) that exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks. For example, it passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT-3.5's score was around the bottom 10%. 


### GPT-J 

GPT-J is an open source artificial intelligence language model developed by EleutherAI. It generally follows GPT-2 architecture with the only major difference of the so-called parallel decoders: instead of placing the feed-forward multilayer perceptron after the masked multi-head attention, they are computed in parallel in order to achieve higher throughput with distributed training.

GPT-J performs very similarly to similarly-sized OpenAI's GPT-3 versions on various zero-shot down-streaming tasks and can even outperform it on code generation tasks. The newest version, GPT-J-6B is a language model based on a data set called The Pile. The Pile is an open-source 825 gigabyte language modelling data set that is split into 22 smaller datasets. GPT-J originally does not function as a chat bot unlike ChatGPT, only as a text predictor. In March 2023, Databricks released Dolly, an Apache-licensed, instruction-following model based on GPT-J with fine-tuning from the Stanford Alpaca dataset.

GPT-J has been used for a variety of tasks, including:

    Text generation
    Code generation
