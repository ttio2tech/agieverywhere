</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Following were tested on both 4600G and 5600G. 5700G should also work. [Products details](/guide/AMDGPU/APU#4600product). 
</Callout>

### hardware requirements: 

* APU (older or newer generations than 4600G, 5600G, 5700G have not been tested.)
* AM4 motherboard which supports the APU, 
* The system is recommended to have at least 32 GB RAM installed. It may not allow to allocate 16 GB RAM if less than 32 GB RAM is available.

My hardware in test:
* MSI B450-A PRO MAX.
* AMD 4600g (with stock cooler)
* 2x16GB RAM (32GB is enough unless larger RAM needed, e.g. GPT-J-6B loading)
* 2x16GB RAM Dominator
* 2TB crucial P1 ssd
* 650W PSU

### Motherboard BIOS setting for APU iGPU

Motherboard brand, BIOS version, ROCm version may affect your mileage. Below is a summary of the tested systems. 
| Motherboard Brand | BIOS version  | Results       | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| MSI B450-A PRO MAX | E7B86AMS.MC0  | working   | tested latest BIOS doesn't work (not able to detect gpu) |
| ASUS ROG Strix B450-A | Latest     | working   |            |
| Gigabyte B450M DS3H Wifi AM4 | Latest  | working  |          | 

### Allocate 16GB system RAM to the APU in BIOS

Enter the BIOS mode after pressing power on button. A common way to enter BIOS setup is to press a specific key or a combination of keys during the startup process, before the Windows logo appears. The key or keys may differ depending on your computer, but some of the most common ones are F1, F2, F10, F12, Del, or Esc.

Within motherboard BIOS, enable ‘Above 4G encoding’ and auto Re-Size BAR support. There are setting to choose primary graphic, igpu or discrete PCIE gpu. Choose igpu. There is also a mode for 'GAME' or 'FORCE'. 'Force' mode allows you to customize the dedicated iGPU VRAM. There are multiple options to set frame buffer size: AUTO,1,2,4,8,16 GB. Please try to upgrade your BIOS version if you can not see the 8 or 16 GB options. Choose 16 GB to allocate 16 GB dedicated RAM to the iGPU. 


To verify, in your terminal, 

```bash filename="checkvram.sh"  copy
sudo dmesg | grep drm | grep amdgpu
```
example output:

## ROCm installation

AMD ROCm (Radeon Open Compute platform) is a software platform designed to enable developers to create high-performance computing applications that can harness the full potential of AMD GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and CPUs (Central Processing Units). It is an open-source platform that provides a wide range of tools, libraries, and support for developing applications in a variety of programming languages, including C++, Python, and Fortran.

The primary goal of ROCm is to provide a unified and consistent programming environment for both AMD GPUs and CPUs, which enables developers to create high-performance applications that can take full advantage of the performance capabilities of both types of processors. With support for advanced features such as HIP (Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability) and OpenCL (Open Computing Language), ROCm provides a flexible and powerful platform for creating a wide range of applications, from machine learning and data analytics to scientific computing and gaming.

Overall, AMD ROCm is a powerful and versatile platform that is well-suited for developers who want to create high-performance computing applications that can run on both GPUs and CPUs, and it is widely used in the scientific computing and machine learning communities.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  ROCm is supported on Linux platform (Ubuntu/Debian, RHEL/CentOS, SLES/OpenSUSE). Recently AMD is adding supports to Windows, but it is not mature yet.  
</Callout>

### Installation instructions on Ubuntu 

To install ROCm for APU, the official documentation should be followed. We have tested ROCm 5.4.0 and ROCm 5.6.0.  

For video turorial for installation of ROCm, please check out the [video tutorials](https://youtu.be/UQqK5fz5wis). 

Below is instructions for installing [ROCm 5.4.0](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-5.4.0/deploy/linux/install_overview.html) on **Ubuntu (20.04.5 LTS)**. For other Linux distributions and other ROCm versions, please check the [official documentation](https://docs.amd.com/). 

1 Install required tools and packages

```bash  copy
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libnuma-dev libncurses5
sudo apt-get install wget gnupg2 gawk curl
sudo reboot
```

2 Setting Permissions for Groups

This step is needed so add any current user can access GPU resources. 
```bash  copy
sudo usermod -a -G render $LOGNAME
sudo usermod -a -G video $LOGNAME
```



3 Check if kernel headers and development packages are installed on the system:`
```bash  copy
sudo dpkg -l | grep linux-headers
sudo dpkg -l | grep linux-modules-extra
```

4 Add the gpg key:
```bash  copy
curl -fsSL https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/rocm-keyring.gpg
```

5 Add the AMDGPU repository:
```bash  copy
echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/rocm-keyring.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu/5.4/ubuntu focal main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/amdgpu.list
```

6 Install the kernel-mode driver and reboot the system:
```bash  copy
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install amdgpu-dkms
sudo reboot
```

7 Add the ROCm repository:
```bash  copy
echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/rocm-keyring.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/5.4 focal main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list
echo -e 'Package: *\nPin: release o=repo.radeon.com\nPin-Priority: 600' | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/rocm-pin-600
sudo apt-get update
```

8 Install the single-version ROCm meta-packages:
```bash  copy
sudo apt install rocminfo rocm-smi rocm-device-libs
sudo apt install rocm-dev
```
9 Add environment varibles 
Add following to your ~/.bashrc file so they can persists:

```bash {1} copy
export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0 #see below for comments
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rocm-5.4.0/lib
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The **HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0** is ciritical for APU GPU to work with ROCm.
</Callout>


### Verification
You may consider ROCm installation successful if GPUs are listed with the following commands: 
```bash  copy

Check ROCm version:
```bash copy
apt show rocm-libs -a
``` 

## Troubleshooting
1. There may be rare cases that hardware caused the error. 
For example, I encountered following error: 
>hsa_status_error_memory_aperture_violation: the agent attempted to access memory beyond the largest legal address
>
It turned out that I have additional environment variables for ROCm. Remove them then the error went away. 

2. When a discrete AMD GPU installed, when using igpu, it gives error:   
> Segmentation fault (core dumped)
It seems that the APU will not work properly in such builds (tested on 5700XT or 6700XT). 
But if the discrete GPU is not AMD brand, the APU GPU can work properly. 




## Create python virtual environment 

Virtual environments are recommended. Anaconda or Miniconda can be used to create virtual Python environment. Refer to the official documentation for the installation. 

Create an environment called py39torchamd and activate it: 
```bash copy
conda create -n py39torchamd python==3.9  
conda activate py39torchamd
```

It is recommend to create a separate python virtual environment for tensorflow. 

Create an environment called py39torchamd and activate it: 
```bash copy
conda create -n py39tfrocm python==3.9
conda activate py39tfrocm
```

1. Install some dependencies for Ubuntu: 
```bash copy 
sudo apt install rocm-libs hipcub miopen-hip          
sudo apt install rccl
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/rocm/rccl/lib  
sudo ldconfig
``` 
2. Install Tensorflow-ROCm
```bash copy
pip3 install --user tensorflow-rocm --upgrade
```

3. Verification 
You can check all device list using following code:
```bash copy 
python -c "from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib; device_lib.list_local_devices()" 
```
It should list the GPU device.

### Pytorch 

To release the full potential of AMD ROCm platform, ROCm compiled Pytorch is available. Pytorch 2.0 ROCm version may not be stable at the time (May 2023), so Pytorch 1.13.1 is used here. 

<Tabs items={['🧑‍💻 Conda or virtualenv', '🚏 Docker']}>
  <Tab>
  1. Install Pytorch-RoCm 
  Use following script to install: 

  ```bash  copy
  # ensure the virtual environment is activated 
  conda activate py39torchamd
  pip install torch==1.13.1+rocm5.2 torchvision==0.14.1+rocm5.2 torchaudio==0.13.1+rocm5.2 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.2
  ```

  2 Verification
  To verify the successful installationa of Pytorch-ROCm, run following script in virtual environment. It should return 'True'. 
  ```bash copy
  python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
